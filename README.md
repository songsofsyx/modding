# modding

Welcome great lord.

This repository contains the modable files of the latest version of the game. The master branch is what's in your {game installation folder}/res/data/assets folder if you have the latest version of the game.

It's here on github so that you, as a modder or translator, kan keep track of what files are beeing added / changed / removed between official updates, and may help you keep your mods up to date.
