		TEXT: 
		"A ferocious four-legged mammal, an Entelodont can both feed a family for several days, while inspiring fear in the hearts of hunters. Their thick hides can blunt the impact of any hunting weapon if not used with enough strength while its ferocity and fearlessness often lead the hunters of these creatures to at best lose their pride, at worst, their lives.",
