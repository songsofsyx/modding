		TEXT: "Farms are where subjects turn soil, water, sunlight and time into useful crops, such as grain or cotton.
The work process is governed by the four seasons: 
%r%%r%
Spring - Clearing weeds%r%
Summer - Tending to the crops%r%
Autumn - Harvesting%r%
Winter - Resting
%r%%r%
This means that a farmer isn't very busy during the Spring and Winter and is available for other chores.

Farms are best placed on ground with high fertility. You can see soil fertility by holding the right mouse button 
on the map. If a farm gets all the work it needs, the farmer's work skill and tool level can double the yield. Technologies and bonuses can further increase this.
Rainfall and irrigation also influence yield. An 8x8 farm with 30% fertility produces, at minumum, about enough food for 1 subject. A 100% fertile farm of the same size will produce enough food for 8 subjects.
