		TEXT: "More of a marker than a room. Woodcutters are built instantly and mark an area of the map where you want to employ a number of subjects to cut down trees and produce the wood resource. Woodcutters will work within the circle shown during the placing process until all designated trees havebeen felled. Trees will regrow in time, but that process is slow. %r%%r%Unlike just clearing the trees within the area by selecting it for clearing, woodcutters produce more wood.Output is governed by a worker's skill, racial bonuses, and technologies.
		Wood is a Primary Resource. The importance of this resource cannot be overstated. It is used predominantly as a construction material, and  is needed to construct the Carpenter's room which produces Furniture, a Secondary Resource, from wood. Wood is also used by the Coaler to make Coal, which is a Secondary Resource. It is harvested from Trees. Trees can be planted individually and those chopped can regrow.",
