**
**			REPUTATION
**
**	Herein lies everything reputation related. 
**	NAME and DESC are self-explanatory.
**	MIN and MAX are decimal values, determining the relative value of the stat.
**	POW represents the exponent that is applied to the value.
**	
**	In the game the product of all these stats determines your total reputation. Your max reputation is thus the product
**	of all the stats MAX value. Stats that have a MIN < 1 are thus able to bring down you reputation significantly.
