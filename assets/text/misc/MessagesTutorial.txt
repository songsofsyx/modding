In the end you'll have to explore the game yourself, or ask around the social channels online, but I'll try to guide you through the initial part.

At your disposal are a few building materials and food. Make good use of them. This is also the centre of your city - the throne.
%r%%r%
There is still time to reap a harvest this year. Your immediate objective is to build a couple of farms. You'll find the farms int the bottom panel room menu. Try building them near the water where fertility is high. To complete this task, you need 3 farms of 8x8 tiles each. they must be of en edible resource. Fruit, or vegetable. Hold up on the mushroom farms, since they're built inside structures. You need some initial seeds for your farms, so inspect the piles in your throne room to get a sense of what farms you can build.

Very good! Your settlers will now automatically assign themselves as farmers and start working the fields. If you find yourself short of food, you can also make a hunter or two and manually collect wild stuff durning the summer. Now we need storage for the coming harvest. It's time to build a warehouse. Make the room around 7x7 tiles, and be careful not to overspend your resources. %r%%r%
Furnish your warehouse with at least 8 crates.

Excellent. Once you have enough food, your reputation will increase and more people will arrive to your promising city. Idle subjects will now start hauling food to the designated crates. However, specialized workers do their tasks best, which is why you should assign a deliveryman to your stockpile. Click the stockpile and increase workers to 1.

Now you've got the basics set up, and can probably survive the winter. To get more wood and stone you can manually select trees and stone to be harvested, or put down woodcutters and stonecutters to do so automatically. Next up, you should build a small carpenter, which will allow you to build furniture for more complex rooms. Keep expanding and exploring the map, but be sure to order 25-50% of your population into the food business to ensure you won't starve. Best of luck, and thanks for playing!
