NAME: "Serpantfly Cultivation",
DESC: "These two insects, while initially thought to be pests, have been found merely to live around vegetables, not consuming them, laying their eggs in them, or in any way, affecting them negatively. What they have been found to do is to get rid by eating, those insects that consume our crops. While they have refused to live around fruit, grain, and are repelled by fungi, they eagerly live around vegetables. Thus, our farmers have started cultivating them as a natural pesticide.",
