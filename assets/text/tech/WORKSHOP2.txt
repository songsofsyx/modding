NAME: "Light Shafts",
DESC: "It is as clear as day to all, that working with daylight is superior to any artificial lighting that we can provide our workers. As such, experiments in creating light shafts in the walls of our workshops, and even in the ceilings, has allowed a considerable degree of daylight, more than general purpose windows, doors, but less than expensive, and architecturally complex skylights when considering the bulk of our workstations. In short, this has allowed our foremen to have workers work slightly more efficiently, as their eyes are less taxed by artificial light.",
