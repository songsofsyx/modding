NAME: "Tool Specialisation",
DESC: "Tools are used in all forms of production, even if they are just a stone or a stick in one's hands. Improvements apart from the energies spent by dedicated tool makers, such as special techniques involving specially cut sticks, or stone cut in special ways and this, following the traditions of the ancient Aegyptecs who survive today only through inscriptions on their temples in the jungles, we can copy these simple hand tool refinements and specialisations to improve the refinement of primary materials, hence increasing the yield during this process.",
